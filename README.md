# XYZ Reader

This project is part of Android Developer Nanodegree's program at Udacity.  It involves redesigning an app to meet the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. It gives an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What is the benefit for me to do this project?

- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Learn and apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.

## Problem that need to be solved based on user feedback:

- Lyla says: 
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”
- Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."
- Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
